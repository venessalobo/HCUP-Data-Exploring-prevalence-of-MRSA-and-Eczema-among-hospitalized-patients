# HCUP-Data-Exploring-prevalence-of-MRSA-and-Eczema-among-hospitalized-patients
Exploring the prevalence of MRSA and Eczema among hospitalized patients over 2009-2014 

As part of my INFX 573 - Data Science I: Theoretical Foundations class, my project focused on exploring the prevalence of MRSA and Eczema among hospitalized patients
over the years 2009 - 2014.

The available data is sampled to perform a case-control analysis. Some of the confounding factors taken into consideration are age, gender, admission month and admission type.
The main research questions addressed are:
1. How often does Eczema diagnosis co-occur with MRSA, over the years 2009 - 2014, among hospitalized patients in the state of Washington?
2. Is MRSA diagnosis more common in patients with skin infections or patients who have undergone surgical procedures, among hospitalized patients in the state of Washington?
3. Are incidents of MRSA and Eczema co-occurence more frequent in hospitalized children (0-3 years) compared to hospitalized older patients (above 60 years) in the state of Washington?
